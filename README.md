# OASIS Editorial Resources project

The OASIS Editorial Resources project, along with the companion Kavi group, is a central location for assets to help OASIS technical community members - editors, open source developers, chairs, tc. - work effectively within the OASIS model. It also acts as a locus for those who want to manage tools or stylesheets.
